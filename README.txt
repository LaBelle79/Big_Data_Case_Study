Hadoop Case Study 2.2.4
************************

Process Automation:

1) SQL/HQL Files with all the tables' syntax
2) Job Properties
3) Workflow
4) Coordinator


**These steps automate the process on 2.2.3 by scheduling Oozie workflow through the coordinator. Job Properties will connect to the coordinator and the coordinator will communicate with the workflow to run the jobs/workflow on a defined times during the day/week.
